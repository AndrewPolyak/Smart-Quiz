# Smart-Quiz

1. Login system + UI. Store database of usernames and passwords. (Stored in SQL database? Some server? Or some long list idk.)  
2. UI + interface to upload "content". docx/pdf/powerpoints of group content. Might have to trim them manually beforehand to get rid of irrelevant/useless info.
3. AI processes the content, Creates question and answer pairs, stores them in .json file
4. Quiz UI populated with JSON file. 
5. XP system based on scores of tests: (94% = 94xp). More XP = cooler badges or something idk
